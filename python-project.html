    <p class="generic-small">The first step my partner and I took in creating Tic-Tac-Toe was designing the game board. We designed the game board by making three rows of alternating spaces and vertical lines, and each row was separated by a large horizontal line. For the game’s code, we created a separate variable for each space, and each turn, the “player” variable would alternate between “X” and “O”. Next, we created a function where the player would select a number on the numpad, and the indicated space would be filled in with the “player” variable. At the end of the turn, another function would be called that checks the board for any winning patterns, which ends the game if the function returns as true. Otherwise, the code would loop back and another turn would be played. These “move” and “check_win” functions were made independently by me. One problem the game initially had was the case of a tie, in which there were no moves left but no winning pattern. We solved this problem by having the game automatically end if nine turns have been played. Another problem we found in our game’s code was the fact that the spaces wouldn’t reset after each game. This was solved by creating a section of code that resets the spaces and game board after each game. As a final touch, we imported termcolor into our program so we could color the “X” and “O” spaces.
